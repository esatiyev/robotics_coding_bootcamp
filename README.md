# RoboCode Robotics Bootcamp (February-March 2024)
Robotics coding bootcamp held by Turkish companies: Bilişim Vadisi and Saha Robotics


## Description: Participated in an educational robotics bootcamp where I collaborated with a team to develop optimal navigation software for a robot using ROS2 and the Nav2 framework. Our project focused on path planning and autonomous navigation, and our team secured 1st place in the competition.
## My Role: Led the development of the robot’s path-planning algorithm, optimized code for speed and efficiency, and coordinated the team's efforts to ensure smooth integration with the robot’s hardware.
